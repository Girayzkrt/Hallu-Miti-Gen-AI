Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "llm_answer": "Tuberculosis patients in China are generally adherent to prescribed treatments, with a reported adherence rate of 95.2%.
