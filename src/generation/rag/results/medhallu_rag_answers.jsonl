The study shows that mitochondrial dynamics change during PCD in the lace plant, and these changes are associated with the fragmentation of nuclear DNA.

Keywords: []. ['Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.'\n 'The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (Î”Î¨m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.']\n(Relevance Score: 0.920)", "context_metadata": [], "model": "mistral:instruct", "response_time": 2.83, "original_article_id": "PMC1", "original_question_type": "Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution", "Difficulty Level": "medium"}

We use a conditional-multinomial logit model to estimate the determinants of her facility choice to visit and how women tradeoff travelling longer distances to use higher quality facilities. Only 33% of woman who received contraception from a health facility used their nearest facility. While the nearest facility was 1.2 km away, the average distance to facility used was 2.9 km, indicating women are willing to travel significantly longer distances for higher quality. Women prefer facilities that specialise in providing contraception, provide a large range of methods, do not suffer from stock outs and do not charge fees.

In addition to growth rate, several other variables considered suitable for predicting neoplastic polyps were also investigated. A nomogram was created to predict neoplastic polyps. A total of 239 patients with neoplastic polyps (n = 27, 11.3%) and non‐neoplastic polyps (n = 212, 88.7%) were included. The median follow‐up period was 28.5 months. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of polyp growth rate for neoplastic polyps was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.59–0.72). The growth rate cutoff value for prediction of neoplastic polyps was 3 mm/year (sensitivity, 37.0%; specificity, 86.3%). Multivariate analysis identified several factors predicting neoplastic polyps: polyp size ≥10 mm (odds ratio [OR], 3.74, p = 0.041), solitary polyp (OR, 3.92, p = 0.004), and polyp growth rate ≥ 3 mm/year (OR, 2.75, p = 0.031).

Objective: To investigate the effect of bracket–ligature combination on the amount of orthodontic space closure over three months. Design: Randomized clinical trial with three parallel groups. Setting: A hospital orthodontic department (Chesterfield Royal Hospital, UK). Participants: Forty-five patients requiring upper first premolar extractions. Methods: Informed consent was obtained and participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and elastomeric ligatures; conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and Super Slick® low friction elastomeric ligatures; Damon 3MX® passive self-ligating brackets. Space closure was undertaken on 0·019×0·025-inch stainless steel archwires with nickel–titanium coil springs. Participants were recalled at four weekly intervals. Upper alginate impressions were taken at each visit (maximum three). The primary outcome measure was the mean amount of space closure in a 3-month period. Results: A one-way ANOVA was undertaken [dependent variable: mean space closure (mm); independent variable: group allocation]. The amount of space closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0·718).

Campaign. Keywords: ['child sexual abuse images', 'internet', 'online sex offending', 'campaign']. Public campaigns offer an opportunity to prevent child sexual abuse by raising awareness and promoting help available to bystanders, victims, and those at risk of perpetrating the abuse. This paper explores the impact of The Lucy Faithfull Foundation’s ‘Stop It Now!’ campaign in the UK (2015–2018) on help-seeking. Helpline calls (11,190 unique callers), website analytics (109,432 new website visitors) and three website-hosted surveys (N = 252) provided data on help-seeking, awareness, and self-reported behavior. Results indicated that there were more visitors to the help website during active campaigning periods, and helpline callers and website visitors were more likely to seek help after viewing campaign materials during active than non-active campaign periods. Help-seekers were predominantly men concerned about their own behavior. Survey 2 respondents concerned about their own behavior (n = 53) indicated that their awareness of the law (75.5%), and legal and personal consequences (67.9%) had changed after hearing about the campaign, and 66% reported a change in behavior. Public health campaigns may be an effective way to promote help-seeking and prevent abuse.\n(Relevance Score: 0.848)", "context_metadata": [], "model": "mistral:instruct", "response_time": 2.29, "original_article_id": "PMC256", "original_question_type": "Misinterpretation of #Question#", "Difficulty Level": "medium"}

In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence.

The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered.
